- help on 495 question
- should there be pictures of the physical components for den 161, me 400, me 535, me 571

Answers:
For me 535, try to do something with ADC to read a voltage or something.
Hard to really set it apart - might not be worth adding?
Might make more sense to look into the labview connection and just prove that it could be used
with the labview. Students have to write some code for the pico to read the ports?

Defense needs to be no later than April 7th
March 20th the thesis needs to be done and sent out with the permission to defend
Then make changes by April 12th and send of to the Graduate Committee of school (not my committee)
