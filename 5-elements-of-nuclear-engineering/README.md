# NE 495: Elements of Nuclear Engineering

This repository contains three problems, two homework questions and one exam question, that could be given as assignments in Intro to Nuclear Engineering. A skeleton to be given to students as well as a solution for instructors is provided. The skeleton contains the problem statement and the necessary imports for generating a solution.

These questions make use of four different libraries for constants, attenuation coefficients, and elemental properties. The use of each library may not be self-explanatory to students, so running through one of the two homework problems from [assignment-2](../5-elements-of-nuclear-engineering/assignment_2/) as an example would benefit students.

## Files in the Repository

* [assignment-1](../5-elements-of-nuclear-engineering/assignment-1/)
  * [exam_1_skeleton.ipynb](../5-elements-of-nuclear-engineering/assignment-1/exam_1_skeleton.ipynb): Starting file to be given as an assignment description to students, or in this case, as part of an exam.
