    "\n",
    "It has been proposed to extract uranium from sea water to produce nuclear reactor fuel. Assume that the total volume of the oceans is 1.3 × 109 km3, the uranium concentration in the ocean is 3 parts per billion water molecules, and the total annual electricity consumption in the U.S. is 4,095 Billion kWh (1 kWh = 3.6 × 106 J). Assume further that every single $ {}^{235}U $ nucleus fissions according to the reaction n + ${}^{235}U$ → ${}^{139}Ba$ + ${}^{95}Kr$ + 2n and that 30% of all of the energy can be recovered for electrical production. \n",
