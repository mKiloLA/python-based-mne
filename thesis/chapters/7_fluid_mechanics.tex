\section{Project Deliverables}

In the GitHub repository associated with this paper, which can be found in 
Appendix \ref{appendix:appendix_github}, the folder titled ``fluid-mechanics''
contains both the problem statement and solution guide for the problem introduced in 
the previous section. The folder also contains a README that details what is in each file and 
what software is needed to complete the assignments. 

For these projects to be added to the class, the instructor would simply need to give the 
skeleton files to students as a problem statement. Given the use of specialized solving
methods used in the solution, an in-class example would be all but required.
