\section{Current Implementation}

ME 570: Control of Mechanical Systems relies heavily on MATLAB for the completion of Labs and Homeworks. 
All work is done using .mlx files through a licensed copy of MATLAB for a more interactive working 
environment. To access the controls related commands, a package called the Controls Toolbox has to be 
purchased from MATLAB. For Labs, a special piece of equiment called the MotorLab is used to collect motor 
data. This device has a GUI that runs through MATLAB, as well as some built in functions made for MATLAB.

\section{Project Redesign}
Change a homework assignment that needs matlab and use python for it. 
Change a lab that needs the motorlab and use python instead of matlab
