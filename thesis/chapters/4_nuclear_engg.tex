\section{Current Implementation}
No usage of programming (as of when I took it, need to reach out 
to current instructor). Q-value assignments were large emphasis 
and all done by hand

\section{Project Redesign}
Create new homework assignments that require interpolation and 
iteration of q-values and require programming to iterate through 
them. Have a standard library with valuesthey can import and use.
