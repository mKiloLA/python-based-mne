Talk about what classes currently utilize programming and electronics 
and what languages/hardware they use. Discuss experience as instructor 
of controls/design 1/2 where students do not know how to code at 
all - even simple scripting (this makes it hard to teach controls or 
design when students do not even know how to operate the platform they
are learning on). Also talk about the main components that will be 
used to complete the projects: pico, vscode, python
