\section{Current Implementation}
Waiting on projects from Dr. Brockhoff still. Uses mostly C++ and 
Arduino Megas / ESP32s for projects. Minimal python to end the 
semester. 

\section{Project Redesign}
Change the class to use only python, increase the learning period 
at the beginning. Pick one project (maybe the buzzer one because it 
would be fun) and replicate it using pico and micropython.
