\section{Current Implementation}
Bonus section since it is an elective. Three main projects in the 
class: wall following, line following, and free drive. Favorite is 
the maze solver, but might be realistic to do free drive since the 
others require getting a set up to test them

\section{Project Redesign}
switch from the arduino mega to pico and use micropython instead. 
Only concern is the number of gpio pins on the pico. might not have 
enough for everything that has to be used for maze solver

\section{Redesigned Project Deliverable}
