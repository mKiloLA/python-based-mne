\section{Current Implementation}
No projects currently exist. Currently any assignments require 
looking through tables in back of book endlessly. Interpolation is 
done by hand.

\section{Project Redesign}
Create new homework assignments (or a semester project?) that requires iteration of a property that would typically be overly tedious without software help. Could potentially utilize curve fitting for better interpolation than straight linear interpolation.
