\section{Current Implementation}
Currently no usage of programming in machine design. Graphs are drawn 
by hand and tables are used to find youngs modulus or inertia values.

\section{Project Redesign}
Make homework assignments that require iteration to solve and would 
therefore be tedious without programming. Computer graphed functions 
for deflection curves
