\section{Course Overview}
Dean of Engineering 161: Engineering Problem Solving is a lab-style
course that complements the lecture-oriented DEN 160: Engineering
Orientation. The class focuses on providing hands-on, problem
solving experiences through projects from multiple engineering 
disciplines. 

The class focuses on introducing students to methods such as project
planning with Gantt charts, concept generation with varying 
techniques, and designing through reverse engineering, and tools 
such as Excel, Python, and Arduino to solve complex problems. 

The class aims not only to give students baselines capabilities that 
will allow them to succeed in future classes but also an oppurtunity 
to see 

Engineering Problem Solving currently takes two weeks to learn the 
basics of Python. The lectures and assignments focus on data
calculations to verify designs and general code inspection to 
understand the different available options. After these two weeks 
of Python, two more weeks are spent doing a Stoplight Activity that 
utilizes an Arduino Nano, the Arduino IDE, and C++. The primary goal 
of the project is to give students a baseline understanding of what 
programming and electronics make possible.

\section{Project Integration}
To build upon the two weeks of Python, as well as maintaining a 
consistent development environment, the stoplight activity will be 
redesign to utilize a Raspberry Pi Pico as the primary microcontroller. The IDE will be Visual Studio Code, which requires an extension to easily work on the Pico. The Pico will be flashed with MicroPython, a light-weight variant of Python.
