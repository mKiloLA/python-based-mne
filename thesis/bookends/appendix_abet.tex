The following exerept is taken directly from K-State's website \cite{abet}:

Student outcomes describe what students are expected to know and be 
able to do by the time of graduation. These relate to the knowledge, 
skills and behaviors that students acquire as they progress through 
the program. The mechanical engineering program will enable students 
to attain the following, by the time of graduation:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item an ability to identify, formulate, and solve complex engineering problems by applying principles of engineering, science, and mathematics
    \item an ability to apply engineering design to produce solutions that meet specified needs with consideration of public health, safety, and welfare, as well as global, cultural, social, environmental, and economic factors
    \item an ability to communicate effectively with a range of audiences
    \item an ability to recognize ethical and professional responsibilities in engineering situations and make informed judgments, which must consider the impact of engineering solutions in global, economic, environmental, and societal contexts
    \item an ability to function effectively on a team whose members together provide leadership, create a collaborative and inclusive environment, establish goals, plan tasks, and meet objectives
    \item an ability to develop and conduct appropriate experimentation, analyze and interpret data, and use engineering judgment to draw conclusions
    \item an ability to acquire and apply new knowledge as needed, using appropriate learning strategies.
\end{enumerate}
