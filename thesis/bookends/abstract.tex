    Talk about the how programming is important and people need to 
    learn it. Then talk about how many do not seem confident in 
    programming and avoid it like the plague. One fix could be a 
    more cohesive and structured approach to programming throughout 
    the program. This research proves it is possible to have one 
    language, environment, and hardware set for the entire degree.
