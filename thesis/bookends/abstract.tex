The ability to apply modern solution methods is critical for the success
of mechanical engineers. While handwritten solutions were once the 
state of the art, computer programs provide unparalleled power and speed 
to solve problems. Because of this, it is critical that academic 
curriculum teaches students to use programming to solve problems.
The current implementation of programming in the department varies,
with three different languages being used. The usage rate also varies,
with many classes failing to take advantage of the tools provided by
programming, and this is reflected by the ability and confidence of
students in the department.
This project demonstrates how it is possible to use one programming 
language and environment through the mechanical engineering
undergraduate curriculum. The completed projects and assignments
showcase the varying uses of Python, the Raspberry Pi Pico, Visual
Studio Code, and Jupyter Notebooks as it relates to problem-solving
in the field of mechanical engineering.
