\section{Current Implementation}
Nearly all labs use programming or hardware for something. Position 
and motion lab might be the most interesting to convert. Want to 
change one that uses labview because that requires significant change

\section{Project Redesign}
Much the same as before. Replace any arduino usage with pico and 
replace labview with python code. Write code functions for students 
or make them parse data themselves? XOD.io?
