# ME 513: Thermodynamics

This repository contains two small example problems that could be given in Thermodynamics. A skeleton to be given to students as well as a solution for instructors is provided. The skeleton contains the problem statement and a recommended structure for the solution. While both questions can see benefits from using Python, Problem 8.33 makes use of iteration and plotting, giving a better perspective on the benefits of programming.
