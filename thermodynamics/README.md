# ME 513: Thermodynamics

This repository contains two problems that could be given as assignments in Thermodynamics. A skeleton to be given to students as well as a solution for instructors is provided. The skeleton contains the problem statement and a recommended structure for the solution. While both questions can see benefits from using Python, Problem 8.33 makes use of iteration and plotting, giving a better perspective on the benefits of programming.

## Files in the Repository

* [Problem_8_23](../thermodynamics/Problem_8_23/)
  * [Thermo_Project_Skeleton_(8_23).ipynb](../thermodynamics/Problem_8_23/Thermo_Project_Skeleton_(8_23).ipynb): Starting file to be given as an assignment description to students.
