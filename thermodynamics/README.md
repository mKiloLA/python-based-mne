# ME 513: Thermodynamics

This repository contains two problems that could be given as assignments in Thermodynamics. A skeleton to be given to students as well as a solution for instructors is provided. The skeleton contains the problem statement and a recommended structure for the solution. While both questions can see benefits from using Python, assignment_2 makes use of iteration and plotting, giving a better perspective on the benefits of programming.

## Files in the Repository

* [assignment_1](../thermodynamics/assignment_1/)
  * [Thermo_Project_Skeleton_(8_23).ipynb](../thermodynamics/assignment_1/assignment_1_skeleton.ipynb): Starting file to be given as an assignment description to students.
  * [Thermo_Project_Solution_(8_23).ipynb](../thermodynamics/assignment_1/assignment_1_solution.ipynb): One possible solution for assignment 1.
* [assignment_2](../thermodynamics/assignment_2/)
  * [Thermo_Project_Skeleton_(8_33).ipynb](../thermodynamics/assignment_2/assignment_2_skeleton.ipynb): Starting file to be given as an assignment description to students.
  * [Thermo_Project_Solution_(8_33).ipynb](../thermodynamics/assignment_2/assignment_2_solution.ipynb): One possible solution for assignment 2.
