# Implementing a Cohesive Programming Ecosystem in Mechanical Engineering

This repository serves as the project base for a thesis entitled *Implementing a Cohesive Programming Ecosystem in Mechanical Engineering*. Of the ten folders, eight are dedicated to different courses in the Mechanical Engineering curriculum at Kansas State University. Each class folder contains the resources needed to give and evaluate various engineering problems related to the subject. As the title suggests, the primary goal of the project is to promote the use of a single programming language and environment to give students a stronger foundation in programming. As such, each assignment is solved using Python in Visual Studio Code to give a consistent learning environment. For a more detailed look into the reasoning for the project and background on the classes, see the associated [thesis](./thesis/out/main.pdf).

## Usage and Installation

Since this repository a represents a collection of projects, the required software installation and usage varies by class. Each class has a `README.md` file that details the software, Visual Studio Code extensions, and Python packages required to run complete the assignments. In general, each project requires a download of Python, Visual Studio Code, and a handful of extensions for Visual Studio Code. The [usage-and-installation](./usage-and-installation/) contains guides for installing [Python](./usage-and-installation/installing_python.pdf), [Visual Studio Code](./usage-and-installation/installing_visual_studio_code.pdf), and the [extensions](./usage-and-installation/installing_visual_studio_code.pdf). The Python installation guide also contains information on how to install the Python packages used across the entire project. Alternatively, the dependencies can be installed from the [requirements.txt](./usage-and-installation/requirements.txt) file using the command ```pip install -r requirements.txt``` from the root directory of `usage-and-installation`.

For additional information, see the [README](./usage-and-installation/README.md) in the usage and installation folder.
