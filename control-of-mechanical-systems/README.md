# Controls

## Current State

ME 570: Control of Mechanical Systems relies heavily on MATLAB for the completion of Labs and Homeworks. All work is done using .mlx files through a licensed copy of MATLAB for a more interactive working environment. To access the controls related commands, a package called the Controls Toolbox has to be purchased from MATLAB. For Labs, a special piece of equiment called the MotorLab is used to collect motor data. This device has a GUI that runs through MATLAB, as well as some built in functions made for MATLAB.
