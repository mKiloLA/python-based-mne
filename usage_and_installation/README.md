# Usage and Installation

Every project in this repository can be run in one environment. To set it up, follow the following instructions:

1. Following the guide in [installing_visual_code.pdf](../usage_and_installation/installing_visual_studio_code.pdf), install Visual Studio Code and its extensions.
2. Following the guide in [installing_python.pdf](../usage_and_installation/installing_python.pdf), install Python and the necessary Python packages.

If this is for student use, that is the final step. If this is for a computer in the Controls lab, then see the [README.md](../usage_and_installation/motorlabGUI/README.md) in the the motorlabGUI folder for further instructions.

While each class folder lists exactly which extensions and packages are needed, the installation instructions gives directions for installing every extension and package used. There is no harm in doing this. If a user wishes to install only what is necessary, this can be done by searching for a specific extension or calling ```pip install``` on a single library name, e.g. ```pip install matplotlib```.
