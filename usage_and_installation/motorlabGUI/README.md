# motorlabGUI

The motorlabGUI is an application made by Dale Schinstock to operate and record data from the motorlab. Previously, the application was run through MATLAB, but thanks to the MATLAB Compiler, it no longer requires a MATLAB installation to run. The application does require the free download of MATLAB Runtime. After installation, the path to the executable can be added to the PATH and can then be run just the same as any other application.

Due to the size of the executable, the files for installing the motorlabGUI cannot be stored on GitHub. They can be accesed [here](https://ksuemailprod-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/zcoster_ksu_edu/EjaRwGS9zqZNiUtPQsxe3-UB80in87yNBQshnAZtNO4eMg?e=mIYpaw) on OneDrive.

## Software Requirements

Since the motorlabs are only used in lab, the following software would need to be installed on every computer in the Controls lab:

* Applications
  * MATLAB Runtime
  * motorlabGUI.exe

Once the motorlabGUI has been installed, add file location to the PATH of your operating system. For instructions on adding locations to the PATH, see [add_to_path_windows.pdf](..\usage_and_installation\add_to_path_windows.pdf).
